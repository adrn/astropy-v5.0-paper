\begin{acknowledgments}

We would like to thank the members of the community that have contributed to
\astropy, that have opened issues and provided feedback, and have supported the
project in a number of different ways.

The \astropy community is supported by and makes use
of a number of organizations and services outside the traditional
academic community. We thank Google for financing and organizing the
Google Summer of Code (GSoC) program, that has funded severals
students per year to work on \astropy related projects over the
summer. These students often turn into long-term contributors. We also
thank NumFOCUS and the Python Software Foundation for financial
support. Within the academic community, we thank
institutions that make it possible that astronomers and other developers on
their staff can contribute their time to the development of
\astropy projects.  We would like acknowledge the support of the
Space Telescope Science Institute, Harvardâ€“Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics,
and the South African Astronomical Observatory.

Furthermore, the \astropy packages would not exist in their current form without
a number of web services for code hosting, continuous integration, and
documentation; in particular, \astropy heavily relies on GitHub, Travis CI,
Appveyor, CircleCI, and Read the Docs.

\astropypkg interfaces with the SIMBAD database, operated at CDS, Strasbourg,
France. It also makes use of the ERFA library \citep{erfa}, which in turn
derives from the IAU SOFA Collection\footnote{\url{http://www.iausofa.org}}
developed by the International Astronomical Union Standards of Fundamental
Astronomy \citep{sofa}.
